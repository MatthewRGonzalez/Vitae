# Vitae

This file includes my work on the scopus API project. Using these scripts functions requries certain installations, such as elsapy. I have a tweaked version in this folder. I have used Ipython notebook to document my progress and work here, I think my actions are described very clearly. This can be installed with pip or conda, but can be downloaded as a .py file

**Important: This requires an API key to be inserted into the config.json file for anything to work. Either request key or contact me.**

**Important: As currently, the scripts only work on the SU network, this probably has something to with that SU pays for scopus. But, one can probably work remotely by using VPN and remote access**

## Navigation:

The "scripts" folder is the most relevant, but to understand whats going on here you'll probably want to first look at the "functions" folder. The order that one should look at the scripts: "apply to dataframe example", "Vtech_retrieve..", "auth_retrieve (in progress)"

## CSV's

There are many relevant csv files to get to the final project.
They are applied in the following order:

Vtech.csv, AUTH_ID_Data.csv, multiple_authors.csv, VTECH_IDS
